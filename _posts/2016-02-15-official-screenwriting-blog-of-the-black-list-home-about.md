Wired4Film World War Hack Next Page » Interview (Written): Matt Charman ("Bridge of Spies") February 15th, 2016 by Scott A Creative Screenwriting interview with Matt Charman, nominated as co-writer for a 2016 Academy Award for Best Original screenplay for Bridge of Spies: As a Brit, what was it about James Donovan's American story that captured your interest? A great character is a great character, wherever they're from, right? I always loved American history -- especially the Kennedy White House and the Cold War period, and I read the Robert Dalleck book An Unfinished Life, which talked about this American lawyer sent to Cuba by JFK to negotiate with Fidel Castro for the release of the 1,500 servicemen captured after the Bay of Pigs. A footnote said "James Donovan came to prominence for the role he played in the spy swap between Rudolf Abel and Gary Powers", and I thought, "Hang on. Stop. Who is this guy?" So I started digging and I pieced together this remarkable untold story about a genuine American hero who risked his life to pull the world back from the brink, during the most dangerous point in the Cold War. It became an odyssey for me to tell this story. I met with Donovan's son in a coffee shop in New York, and it was a very emotional meeting because he knew how serious I was, and I knew how much his father meant to him. You're credited as the main writer, but Joel and Ethan Coen did their own polish. Was there any addition or subtraction that really perturbed you? There really wasn't. It would be a juicier story it there was, but the truth is, I got lucky so many times on this movie. I wrote a draft, I got notes from Steven Spielberg, then after my second draft, Tom Hanks came aboard, and then I get a call from Steven saying, "The Coen brothers love this story and want to polish it." As a young screenwriter, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and the Coen brothers working together---that's the most incredible film school you could ever have. Tell me about the Coen's contribution. They were able to really punch up the negotiations on the back end of the movie, then they handed the baton back to me to do a pass after they did their pass, to make the movie just sit in a place we all wanted it to. The flavor they brought is so fun and enjoyable. It needed to be entertaining but truthful. So the Coen brothers were delicate about polishing your work? I didn't say that. The Coen brothers are two of the best living screenwriters, and the reason I love their movies so much is that they come at scenes from such an interesting angle. It makes you raise your game as a collaborator. For the rest of the interview, go here. You may download the script for Bridge of Spies here.

Our daily schedule: Monday: Scene-By-Scene Breakdown Tuesday: Plot Wednesday: Characters Thursday: Themes Friday: Dialogue Saturday: Takeaways Today: Scene-By-Scene Breakdown. Here is my take on this exercise from a previous series of posts --- How To Read A Screenplay: After a first pass, it's time to crack open the script for a deeper analysis and you can do that by creating a scene-by-scene breakdown. It is precisely what it sounds like: A list of all the scenes in the script accompanied by a brief description of the events that transpire. For purposes of this exercise, I have a slightly different take on scene. Here I am looking not just for individual scenes per se, but a scene or set of scenes that comprise one event or a continuous piece of action. Admittedly this is subjective and there is no right or wrong, the point is simply to break down the script into a series of parts which you then can use dig into the script's structure and themes. The value of this exercise: \* We pare down the story to its most constituent parts: Scenes. \* By doing this, we consciously explore the structure of the narrative. \* A scene-by-scene breakdown creates a foundation for even deeper analysis of the story.

Gone Girl Scene by Scene Breakdown By Ashley Lara GoIntoTheStory.com 1: Black screen slowly fades into Amy's head resting on Nick's lap. Nick's voice-over establishing uneasiness ("I picture cracking open her skull...") and distrust ("What have we done with each other?"). Amy looks up and Nick. Blackout. 1-2: Title card ("July 5th, 2012\. The Morning Of."). Nick outside of his house in North Carthage, MO. He looks ill. 2-3: Nick with his sister Margot (Go) at The Bar, a local pub that the two of them own. Discuss Nick's 5th year anniversary with Amy. Nick seems to be dreading it. 3-6: Flashback through Amy's diary. She writes about meeting a guy (Nick) at a party. Flashback to the party where they meet and flirt. Both seem interested in each other. 6-7: They leave the party together. Walk through an alley where people are loading powdered sugar into a bakery, creating a sugar storm. Nick stops, wipes sugar off Amy's lips, and kisses her. They go back to his apartment and have sex. 8-10: Back at the bar with Nick and Go. They talk about the scavenger hunts that Amy sets-up on every anniversary. Nick had difficulty last year with the hunt, so he's really dreading it this year. They are interrupted by a call from Nick's neighbor Walter -- Nick and Amy's cat is outside. 10-11: Nick goes back to his house. He notices the door is open, and when he enters he notices that the iron is still on and next to Amy's dress, their coffee table is shattered, and an ottoman is turned upside down. 11-13: Detective Rhonda Boney and Officer James Gilpin are now at the house investigating. They ask Nick about Amy while tagging suspicious areas with post-its. They notice the nice dress -- Nick tells them that it is their anniversary. Boney and Gilpin also discover that Amy's parents wrote the famous Amazing Amy children's books, using Amy as inspiration. 13-18: Amy's diary entry sets up for a flashback to an Amazing Amy book launch party (Feb. 24, 2007). Amy's parents (Rand and Marybeth) have written Amazing Amy and the Big Day, the book where Amy gets married. Amy is less than thrilled to be there. Agrees to answer some press questions. Nick poses as press and proposes to Amy. She accepts. 18-26: Nick is at the police station with Gilpin and Boney. Opens with Gilpin and Boney on the other side of the two-way mirror, watching Nick and discussing how this could become a big deal fast (semi-famous wife goes missing the day of her anniversary...). They then join him in the room, asking him routine questions and swabbing his mouth and hands (for DNA and gunshot residue, respectively). Boney mentions a press conference has been set up for tomorrow and asks if Amy's parents can be there. Nick reveals he hasn't contact Amy's parents. He calls them -- they're upset he didn't call earlier. During the phone call Nick discovers his dad is also at the police station -- he wandered off from his assisted living facility. Nick is released to drive his father back to the assisted living facility. During the drive home Nick pulls out a second cell phone (cheap disposable) in his glove compartment. He dials it, gets voicemail, and hangs up. Nick drops off his dad. 27-28: July 5, 2009\. 2nd anniversary. Nick and Amy on a scavenger hunt in a bookstore. Nick is guessing all the clues. They have sex in a secluded part of the store. 28: At a bar post-bookstore. Nick finds the 3rd clue. 29: At a Dim Sum restaurant. Celebrating with a feast. They both reveal that they purchased the same type of luxury 2,000 thread count bed sheets. In Amy's words "Sometimes I want to punch us in the face we're so cute." 29-30: Back in 2012\. Nick at Go's apartment. He's staying on her couch with 200 thread count sheets. They're prepping for the press conference the next day. Nick's phone buzzes -- he turns it off. 30-32: Boney and Gilpin at the Dunne residence, investigating the house with a forensics team. Noelle Hawthorne, a neighbor of the Dunne's, tries to talk to Boney. Boney tells her leave. They find an envelope marked "First Clue" in Nick and Amy's bedroom. 32-33: Morning of the press conference. Nick is hung over. Go tells Nick to watch himself. 33-34: Nick and Go at the police station. Marybeth and Rand have arrived. They're worried about Amy. 34-35: The press conference. Nick issues a brief (and somewhat cold) statement about Amy's disappearance. Marybeth and Rand issue a more heart-felt plea for the safe return of Amy. The press starts to take photos. Nick stands next to Amy's photo and smiles. The cameras go crazy. Go looks disappointed. 35-36: Boney, Rand, Marybeth, and Nick in a police conference room. Rand and Marybeth mention two men from her past: Desi Collings, her high school boyfriend who attempted suicide after she broke up with him (and now lives in St. Louis); and Tommy O'Hara, a former boyfriend who got physical with her when she broke up with him. Nick knew about Desi (he wrote letters to Amy) but didn't know Tommy. 37: Rand and Marybeth leave. Boney pulls Nick into Boney's office. She presents him with the "Clue One" envelope. Nick discussing their anniversary scavenger hunt. Boney thinks following these clues could help track Amy's whereabouts before she went missing. Nick solves the clue ("Although this spot couldn't be tighter/it's a cozy room for my favorite writer/after school meeting don't mind if I do/maybe I'll teach you a thing or two") and figures out the next clue is in his community college office. 37-39: In his office. They find an envelope marked "Clue Two" (Hey, handsome man---let's go undercover. You be the spy and I'll be his lover. Let's head on over to the little brown house. We'll play hot, doting husband and sweet loving spouse.). Boney finds a red lacy thong and bags it for evidence.

Tanner tells Nick to just say "I'm just happy my wife is safe." The suits (FBI) arrive to ask Amy some questions. Amy recounts her story -- says that Desi forced himself into her house, hit her, and kidnapped her. Boney tries to get to the holes in her story (How did Desi have the handle? How did all the items end up in Go's shed?). Outside of the room, Gilpin mentions to Nick that she slit Desi's throat with a box cutter. Nick asks how did she get the box cutter if her hands were tied up? Gilpin says "Just be happy your wife is safe." Back in the room, Boney asks about the diary they found.

Tanner says to just leave it alone -- they've rebounded financially (Lifetime movie, book rights, the Bar is being franchised). His words of advice is to never turn his back on Amy.

She can't do any more investigating. 158-159: Nick is talking to himself in the bathroom mirror, saying "My wife is lying, murderous sociopath." He walks out and finds Amy the picture of happiness.

Amy tells him he didn't have to -- she used his sample from the fertility clinic. Nick says he won't stay with her because he doesn't love her -- they are toxic together.

Writing Exercise: I encourage you to read the script, but short of that, if you've seen the movie, go through this scene-by-scene breakdown. What stands out to you about it from a structural standpoint? Major kudos to Ashley Lara for doing this week's scene-by-scene breakdown. To download a PDF of the breakdown, go here. Tomorrow: We zero in on the major plot elements in Gone Girl. I am looking for volunteers to read a script and provide a scene-by-scene breakdown for it to be used as part of our weekly series. What do you get? Beyond your name being noted here, my thanks, and some creative juju, hopefully you will learn something about story structure and develop another skill set which is super helpful in learning and practicing the craft. The latest volunteers: 12 Years a Slave -- Georgevine Moss Beasts of No Nation -- Jacob Holmes-Brown Bridge of Spies -- Scott Guinn Carol -- Jillienne Bee Celeste and Jesse Forever -- Ryan Canty Diary of a Teenage Girl -- Cynthia Ex Machina -- Nick Norman-Butler Frozen -- Doc Kane Gone Girl -- Ashley Lara Inside Out -- Katha Legend -- Olivia Leviathan -- Piotr Ryczko Locke -- Megaen Kelly Macbeth -- Trung Man Up -- Kristy Brooks Monsters University -- Liz Correal Mud -- Kevin Nightcrawler -- DJ Summit Pawn Sacrifice -- Michael Waters Steve Jobs -- Angie Soliman Straight Outta Compton -- Timm Higgins The End of the Tour -- Steve F The Iron Lady -- Leslie The Way Way Back -- The Deuce Trainwreck -- Joni Brainerd Wreck It Ralph -- Kenny Crowe Thanks, all! To see examples of scene-by-scene breakdowns, go here. Part of the goal is to create a library of breakdowns for writers to have at their disposal for research and learning. You may see the scripts we can use for the series -- free and legal -- by going here. To date, we have analyzed 53 movie scripts, a great resource for screenwriters. To see those analyses, go here. Thanks to any of you who will rise to the occasion and take on a scene-by-scene breakdown. And for those of you who have volunteered, please send me your scene-by-scene breakdown as soon as possible! Circling back to where we started, reading scripts is hugely important. Analyzing them even more so. If you want to work in Hollywood as a writer, you need to develop your critical analytical skills. This is one way to do that. So seize this opportunity and join in the conversation! I hope to see you in comments about this week's script: Gone Girl.         Posted in read scripts | Tagged Tags: Gone Girl, Scene-by-scene breakdown | Leave a reply 2016 Dialogue-Writing Challenge: Day 11 February 15th, 2016 by Scott Last year at this time, we did a month-long Dialogue-Writing Challenge. It was a big success with dozens of writers participating. We all learned quite a bit about this important aspect of the craft plus we had some fun in the process. So I've decided to bring it back! Every Monday-Friday at noon Eastern / 9AM Pacific in February, I will upload a post with a prompt for writing dialogue. Each day, write a scene per those guidelines. If you really want to get in the spirit of things, upload your scene here in the comments section of the original post. That way you can critique others' pages and receive feedback on your dialogue as well. To provide extra motivation for this series --- to get people to WRITE PAGES --- I am giving away some of my Craft classes to Dialogue-Writing Challenge participants. That's right: For free! The Craft classes highlight key principles and practices tied to the nitty gritty of writing a script. Here is the Craft lineup, the only time I will teach each of these courses in 2016: January 25: Craft: Pixar and the Craft of Storytelling February 8: Craft: Story Summaries February 22: Craft: Handling Exposition March 7: Craft: Scene Description Spotlight April 4: Craft: Character Development Keys May 2: Craft: Create a Compelling Protagonist May 16: Craft: Write a Worthy Nemesis May 30: Craft: The Coen Brothers and the Craft of Storytelling Each is a 1-week online class featuring 7 lectures written by me, lots of screenwriting insider tips, logline workshops, optional writing exercises, 24/7 message board conversations, teleconferences with course participants and myself to discuss anything related to the craft of scriptwriting. A popular option is the Craft Package which gives you access to the content in all eight Craft classes which you can go through on your own time and at your own pace, plus automatic enrollment in each 1-week online course. All for nearly 50% the price of each individual class. And special bonus content: 7 lectures on How to Introduce Characters so a script reader will immediately get a clear sense of who each character is... and be entertained in the process. To qualify to take one of my Craft classes for free, write and submit ten \[10\] Dialogue-Writing Challenge posts, then provide feedback on ten \[10\] posts from other writers. The former to get you writing, the latter to work your critical-analytical skills. A chance to take any of my eight Craft classes, interface with me online along with the usual stellar group of writers who take Screenwriting Master Class courses, while using writing exercises and feedback to upgrade your skill at writing and analyzing dialogue. ISN'T THAT AN AWESOME IDEA?!!! A couple of logistical notes: \* Limit your post to 2 pages. Out of fairness to everyone participating in the public dialogue-writing workshop, let's not abuse anyone's patience or time with really long scenes. \* Give your scenes a beginning, middle and end. You may enter late and exit early, but provide an arc to each of your posts. Even monologues or telephone conversations, both of which we will be doing this month. \* Don't be concerned about proper script format when you copy/paste your pages, rather the content and execution are the important thing. So as a default mode, do this: (1) Don't worry about right-hand margins on scene description or dialogue, just keep typing until it manually shifts each line. (2) Don't worry about character name position, rather do this: SCARLETT: Rhett, Rhett... Rhett, if you go, where shall I go? What shall I do? RHETT: Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn. Today's prompt: "I'm pregnant, asshole." I was just going to go with "I'm pregnant" as a prompt, but "asshole" popped into my head. Besides it gives the exercise that much more intrigue. Who is she? Who is he? Is he really an asshole? Or is she just blurting it out as a result of her shock or frustration at learning she's pregnant? Maybe it's a term of endearment. Whatever, the scene calls for a reaction from the father-to-be, so have some fun with this exercise. Focus on the dialogue, not the action to drive the scene. In most movies, it's the other way around because movies are primarily a visual medium, however sometimes the script requires a dialogue-driven scene and we need to hone our chops at being able to do that effectively. Write a 1-2 page dialogue-centric scene, then copy/paste in comments. If you are interested in qualifying for 1 free Craft class with me, please note in each post you submit the number of scenes you have written. If today is your first effort, note that it is Scene 1\. The next one, Scene 2\. And so forth. Also when you provide feedback on someone's scene, please note in each reply the number of comments you have uploaded. So if today is your first response, Feedback 1\. The next one, Feedback 2\. You are on an honor system, as I don't have time to check every post, so do the right thing! Remember: In order to qualify for one of my free Craft classes, you need to submit ten \[10\] Dialogue-Writing Challenge posts, then provide feedback on ten \[10\] posts from other writers.

It doesn't matter what we write (at least this is my view) at our age, so long as we write continually as well as we can. I feel that every time I write a page either of prose or of verse, with real effort, even if it's thrown into the fire the next minute, I am so much further on." --- C.S.

I'm being followed. MRS. BRISBY: Followed? JEREMY: Ssshhh! There's a crazy lady with a hat. She's got big teeth. She tied me up, and then---ah, oohh! A sparkly! MRS. BRISBY: What? JEREMY: You're wearing a sparkly! Can I hold it? Oh, please, can I? MRS. BRISBY: Jeremy, listen. JEREMY: Wow. MRS. BRISBY: I need lots and lots of string. JEREMY: Stah-ring. MRS. BRISBY: To move the block. JEREMY: Move...the...block. Hey! I've got string. I've been savin' 'em. MRS. BRISBY: You do? JEREMY: Oh, sure. Red ones. Blue ones. Green. Yellow. MRS. BRISBY: Pay attention. Go get all the string you can. JEREMY: Okay. (Takes a deep breath and dives underwater, then resurfaces.) That'll take all day. MRS. BRISBY: Good. Get going. Jeremy again dives under, then re-emerges and pounces on Mrs. Brisby. JEREMY: I, uh, I just thought I'd mention in passing---I've always wanted a sparkly of my very own. MRS. BRISBY: Will you get going! JEREMY: Sure. Uh, excuse me. Uh, pardon me. Uh, bye. --- The Secret of NIMH (1982), story by Don Bluth, John Pomeroy, Gary Goldman, and Will Finn; based on the novel by Robert C. O'Brien The Daily Dialogue theme for the week: Obsession, suggested by Angie Soliman. Today's recommendation by Will King. Trivia: Don Bluth, John Pomeroy and Gary Goldman all left Disney to pursue this project, which had originally been rejected by their former employer as "too dark" to be a commercial success. They were followed soon after by 20 other Disney animators, dubbed "The Disney Defectors" by the trade press. Dialogue On Dialogue: Commentary by Will: "Here the script plays off the myth that crows are attracked to bright, shiny objects. Jeremy the clumsy, scatter-brained crow (delightfully voiced by Dom Deluise) is given a task by Mrs. Brisby, but the jewel she's carrying suddenly takes over Jeremy's complete focus. Almost ready to leave, he tries one last time to try to get Mrs. Brisby to give it up, but is unsuccessful."

It went on to become one of three movies to win the so-called Big Five Oscars: Best Picture, Best Actor, Best Actress, Best Director, and Best Screenplay (Adapted). The other two are It Happened One Night (1934) and One Flew Over the Cuckoo's Nest (1975). The movie is a gem and for screenwriters a master class in handling characters, themes, and story structure. In fact, it's one of my go-to movies when teaching screenwriting theory. Here is a 5 part GITS analysis series we did on the movie: General Comments Structure Characters Themes Dialogue Here is the original trailer for the movie: And here is a 90 minute documentary on the making of The Silence of the Lambs: A Vanity Fair article by Scott Beggs: "The Silence of the Lambs: A Twisted Rom-Com That's Perfect for Valentine's Day". Interview with screenwriter Ted Tally. What are your memories and associations with The Silence of the Lambs?         Posted in movies | Tagged Tags: The Silence of the Lambs | Leave a reply Interview: Sam Regnier (2015 Nicholl Winner) February 14th, 2016 by Scott Sam Regnier wrote the original screenplay "Free Agent" which won a 2015 Nicholl Fellowship in Screenwriting and has been set up at CBS Films. Recently Sam and I had an excellent phone conversation in which we covered a lot of territory, his background and how he got into writing, a deep analysis of "Free Agent", and a discussion about the writing craft. Here are links to the six installments of the entire interview: Part 1: "We would go on these road trips to Colorado or Minnesota, and we would go for two hours, three hours, in the car, and nobody would say a word, because my dad's driving, and the rest of us are reading. That's the way we grew up." Part 2: "It can be really useful to brand yourself. I know in the back of my head that I have much broader ambitions or broader interests, and I am still committed to pursuing them, but we work in a business of creativity and ideas and things that are very ephemeral." Part 3: "I didn't know it at the time, but I was writing about becoming a parent. This was within months of my daughter being born, and her befuddlement and lack of confidence in how handle this new interruption in her life was pretty much a carbon copy of what I was going through." Part 4: "I would say it's 100 percent magic, and 1,000 percent hard work. Writing is such an iterative process, which is something that took me a long time to realize. You write a draft, realizing what pieces fit and which don't. You do another draft, do the same thing." Part 5: "I was sitting, working on a data request at my job, a spreadsheet full of numbers. My phone rang, and he said 'Hey, this is Greg from the Nicholl. Do you have a second?' Immediately, my world went white." Part 6: "You can't fake it. It doesn't fake, not if you want to be able to do it again and again, to make a career. If you want to write great stories continually and stuff that other people can't do, then it has to be personal." Sam is repped by Paradigm and Management SGC. Twitter: @dadbasic.
