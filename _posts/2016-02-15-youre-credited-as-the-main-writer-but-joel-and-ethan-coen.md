You're credited as the main writer, but Joel and Ethan Coen did their own polish. Was there any addition or subtraction that really perturbed you? There really wasn't. It would be a juicier story it there was, but the truth is, I got lucky so many times on this movie. I wrote a draft, I got notes from Steven Spielberg, then after my second draft, Tom Hanks came aboard, and then I get a call from Steven saying, "The Coen brothers love this story and want to polish it." As a young screenwriter, Steven Spielberg, Tom Hanks and the Coen brothers working together---that's the most incredible film school you could ever have.
